*Todays Focus*

<table><tr><td> Ode to a developer:
I wrote a poem to best describe todays experience.:
How do you center a div...<br>
I do not know.. .<br>
does my code show the tears between the lines... .<br>
No just the mistakes in my syntax.<br>
today was definitley harder than bootstrap.<br>

#### My final thoughts

*Tasks 1-3:*
I am currently still working out how to change the active state of the progress portion of my task 3. I am having difficulties, I probably will just hang out in office hours at the next one.

A few questions that I have to ask to help my understanding:

1. Whats the difference between adding an event listener on a button vs adding to an element?
2. I would like to be able to understand "e.target" and then how to and when to properly use it.
3. How can I pull in the html element in js to have a change state/option for progress

##### Reflection Questions

1. Reflection: Write a short reflection (100-200 words) included within the repository discussing:

I found it extremely difficult to find what I am trying to say in the translations of Javascript. Often asking myself where do I start? 
To solve a lot of the problems I face I utilize:
MDN| W3schools| My peers| The Help queue | The office hours | Stack overflow| Trying things out even when nothing works.. Then I will go back and reference documents, and older projects as a starting point and still not know how to quite alter them the way they need in order to get them to work.  I would finish my homework assignment.. I worked diligently all day and feel very defeated rn.
